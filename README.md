##Rocket Math Generator
###Purpose
This little web app lets you generate a simple 1-9 time table exercise sheet for 2nd and 3rd grade students to pratice.

###Install
Simply copy all files to your web server directory, e.g. /var/www/rocketmath, and then point your brower to it.

###Dependency
This code uses FPDF, and it is already included in the source code. So no other external PHP dependency other than standard PHP install and of course a web server.

##Enjoy
